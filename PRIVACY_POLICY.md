# Privacy Policy for Flow Timer - Pomodoro

**Last Updated:** [Date of last update]

Thank you for using Flow Timer - Pomodoro ("the Extension"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the Extension handles and why.

**Our Core Privacy Principle: Your Data is Yours**

The Extension is designed to be a private, local-first tool. We do not have a server, we do not collect any personally identifiable information, and we do not track your browsing activity. All data generated by or for the Extension is stored on your local computer or synced to your personal Google Account, under your control.

### 1. Information We Handle

The Extension handles the following types of data to function correctly:

**a) User-Configured Settings (Stored via `chrome.storage.sync`)**

This data is synchronized across your browsers using your own Google Account so your settings are consistent everywhere you use the Extension. We do not have access to this data.

*   **Timer Durations:** The custom lengths you set for work, short break, and long break sessions.
*   **Blocked & Whitelisted Sites:** The lists of websites you choose to block and whitelist.
*   **Sound Preferences:** Your choice of notification sound.
*   **Timer State:** The current state of the timer (e.g., 'WORK', 'BREAK'), its end time, and the number of completed Pomodoros. This is necessary for the timer to function correctly across browser restarts.
*   **Productivity Statistics (`pomodoroHistory`):** A simple count of completed Pomodoro sessions per day. This data is used solely to render the "Weekly Statistics" chart for you on the options page.

**b) Custom Uploaded Sound (Stored via `chrome.storage.local`)**

*   If you upload a custom notification sound, the audio file is converted to a data format and stored **only on your local computer**. It is not synced and is never transmitted off your device by the Extension.

**c) Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**

The Extension **does not** collect, store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, email address, or IP address.

### 2. Permissions and How They Are Used

The Extension requests certain permissions to provide its features. Here is why we need them:

*   **`storage`**: To save your settings and statistics as described in Section 1.
*   **`declarativeNetRequest` and `host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]`**: This is required for the website blocking feature. The `<all_urls>` permission is necessary so the Extension can block **any site you choose to add to your blocklist**. We use the privacy-preserving `declarativeNetRequest` API, which means the Extension only tells Chrome which sites to block; it **does not read, monitor, or have access to your browsing history or the content of any website**.
*   **`alarms`**: To schedule when a timer session should end. This allows the timer to work reliably and efficiently without constantly running in the background.
*   **`notifications`**: To show you a desktop notification when a work or break session is complete.
*   **`offscreen`**: To play the notification sound at the end of a timer session. This is the modern, official method for playing audio from an extension's background service worker in Manifest V3.
